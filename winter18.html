    KEY TERMS:
    - Bible : The Bible is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans
    - TaNaKh: . Heb. acronym: Torah, Nevi’im (prophets), Ketuvim (writings). In modern times, a widely used designation for the twenty-four books of holy scripture.
    - Pentateuch: (Five books of Moses or the Torah) the first five books of the Old Testament- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy; tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelites to enter the land of Canaan
    - Septuagint: a Koine Greek translation of a Hebraic textual tradition that included certain texts which were later included in the canonical Hebrew Bible and other related texts which were not
    - Documentary Hypothesis: one of three models used to explain the origins and composition of the first five books of the Bible
    - Noahide Covenant: When God wipes out the corrupt society as a form of punishment, Noah, his wife, and his three sons survive. Noah then builds God an altar and sacrifices. The Noahide covenant applies to all of humanity and all living creatures, for God promises that never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood. He then establishes a rainbow as a sign of him and Noah’s covenant, along with all living creatures of every kind.
    - Abrahamic Covenant: found in Genesis 12:1-3, God called to Abram and gave him a command that was also a promise: "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." There were three main parts: God called to Abram and told him to move to another land that God would show him. God told Abraham that his descendants would become a great nation, with mighty kings. There was the promise that God would bring blessing and redemption to all people through Abraham's people, and despite the sins in the lives of all three patriarchs, God's unconditional promise stands.
    - Sinaitic (Mosaic) Covenant: found in Exodus 19-24, made between God and the nation of Israel. God reminded the people of their obligation to be obedient to His law, and the people agreed to the covenant when they said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do!” It is a conditional covenant in that the blessings that God promises are directly related to Israel’s obedience to the Mosaic Law. Descendants of Moses were commanded with seven precepts: to establish laws, not to worship idols (idolatry), not to curse God (blasphemy),  not to commit sexual immorality (adultery), not to commit murder (bloodshed), not to steal (theft), and eating the blood of a living animal.If Israel is obedient, then God will bless them, but if they disobey, then God will punish them.
    - Davidic Covenant: found in 2 Samuel 7, made between God to David through Nathan the prophet. God promises David and Israel that the Messiah (Jesus Christ) would come from the lineage of David and the tribe of Judah and would establish a kingdom that would endure forever. Unconditional because God does not place any conditions of obedience upon its fulfillment. God reaffirms the promise of the land that He made in the first two covenants with Israel (the Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenants). God then promises that David’s son will succeed him as king of Israel and that this son (Solomon) would build the temple.
    - Adam: In the opening chapters of the Book of Genesis, Adam is the first man created by God. God forms "Adam", this time meaning a single male human, out of "the dust of the ground" and "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" (Genesis 2:7). He disobeyed God's command and eats of the tree of knowledge, which expelled him into a world of hard labor. He failed to learn the difference between good and evil and brought suffering into their world.
    - Cain and Abel: Cain and Abel were sons of Adam and Eve in the biblical Book of Genesis. Cain, the firstborn, was a farmer, and his brother Abel was a shepherd. The brothers made sacrifices to God, each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain then murdered Abel, whereupon God punished Cain to a life of wandering.
    - Noah: God's solution to all the evil and violence was to destroy all mankind. Noah and his family were the only human beings found to be worthy of being saved. Noah is often known for his righteousness in a world that had completely turned against God. However, Noah was not morally perfect. After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard, made wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his tent.
    - Abraham: Originally Abram before the Abrahamic Covenant, Jews regarded him as the first patriarch of the Jewish people. Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan, but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Abraham was the first person to teach the idea that there was only one God.
    - Sarah: Wife of Abraham. Mother of Isaac. One of the Matriarchs of Judaism.
    - Hagar: Abraham's second wife, and the mother of Ishmael. Hagar is a biblical person in the Book of Genesis. She was an Egyptian handmaid of Sarai, who gave her to Abraham to bear a child.
    - Ishmael: Ishmael is a figure in the Tanakh and the Quran and was Abraham's first son according to Jews, Christians and Muslims. Ishmael was born to Abraham's and Sarah's handmaid Hagar.
    - Isaac: Son and spiritual heir of Abraham. Father of Jacob (Israel). One of the three Patriarchs of Judaism.
    - Rebecca: Wife of Isaac. Mother of Jacob and Esau. One of the Matriarchs of Judaism.
    - Jacob: Son of Isaac. Father of twelve sons, who represent the tribes of Judaism. One of the three Patriarchs of Judaism.
    - Esau: Son of Isaac; older twin brother of Jacob (Israel).
    - Leah: Wife of Jacob. Mother of six of his sons. Sister of Rachel. One of the Matriarchs of Judaism.
    - Rachel: Rachel one of Jacob's two wives as well as the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. Rachel was the daughter of Laban and the younger sister of Leah, Jacob's first wife. Favorite wife of Jacob. Mother of Joseph and Benjamin. One of the Matriarchs of Judaism.
    - Joseph: Son of Rachel and Jacob. He is an important figure in the Bible's Book of Genesis and also in the Quran. Sold into slavery by his jealous brothers, he rose to become vizier, the second most powerful man in Egypt next to Pharaoh, where his presence and office caused Israel to leave Canaan and settle in Egypt.
    - Moses:  The founder of the Jewish religion and agent (through the power of God) of Israel’s liberation from Egyptian bondage. After leaving Egypt, he twice spent forty days in private communion with God on Mount Sinai and brought down the “teaching” (Torah) that would form the eternal basis of Jewish life. All subsequent forms of Judaism claimed to be in keeping with the teachings of Moses.
    - Aaron: Older brother of Moses. Founder of the priesthood, and the first Kohein Gadol (High Priest). He helped Moses lead the Children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage.
    - Retribution Theology: Retribution theology holds that people are treated by God based on how they behave. God sees to it that the good people get good things in life, and the bad people get bad things. God punishes people in this world in direct response to their actions.
    - Holiness Code: The Holiness Code is a collection of many laws concerning several subjects. The Holiness Code is a term used in biblical criticism to refer to Leviticus chapters 17–26.
    - Joshua: Joshua is the central figure in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Joshua. According to the books of Exodus, Numbers and Joshua, he was Moses' assistant and became the leader of the Israelite tribes after the death of Moses.
    - Judges: is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible. In the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, it covers the time between the conquest described in the Book of Joshua and the establishment of a kingdom in the Books of Samuel, during which Biblical judges served as temporary leaders.
    - Samuel: Samuel is a figure in the Hebrew Bible who plays a key role in the narrative, in the transition from the period of the biblical judges to the institution of a kingdom under Saul, and again in the transition from Saul to David.
    - Saul: Saul was the first king of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah. His reign, traditionally placed in the late 11th century BCE, marked a transition from a tribal society to statehood. He was anointed by the prophet Samuel and reigned from Gibeah.
    - David: David is Israel’s second and greatest king. David courageously defeats a mighty enemy warrior named Goliath with only a sling and a stone and conquers all Israel’s enemies and begins a dynasty that would rule Jerusalem for nearly 500 years. He commits adultery with a woman named Bathsheba, who’s the wife of one of David’s most loyal soldiers, Uriah. Then, to cover up the crime, David has Uriah killed. In David’s favor, when the prophet Samuel confronts David with his sin, David repents. Moreover, in God’s favor, God forgives David for his sin, but not without punishing David for his crime.
    - Solomon: The son of King David and Bathsheba, was the third king of Israel. David was followed by Solomon, famous for his wisdom, who built the first permanent Temple to God in the new royal capital, Jerusalem.
    - Northern Kingdom: Kingdom of Israel
    - Southern Kingdom: Kingdom of Judah
    - Nebuchadnezzar: He was considered the greatest king of the Babylonian Empire. Nebuchadnezzar is most famous for the conquering of Judah and the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem in 586 BC
    - Diaspora: Any place outside of the land of Israel where Jews live. Refers to the fact that Jews were dispersed from the land of Israel by the Romans after the last Jewish War.  The Diaspora began with the Babylonian Exile, and by the start of the Common Era a majority of the world’s Jews lived outside their ancient national homeland.
    - Edict of Cyrus: It is part of the biblical narrative about the return from Babylonian captivity. It is presented as authorizing and encouraging the Jews exiled by Nebuchadnezzar to relocate to the Land of Israel and actively engage in rebuilding the temple destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar.
    - Ezra: religious leader of the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon, reformer who reconstituted the Jewish community on the basis of the Torah .  His work helped make Judaism a religion in which law was central, enabling the Jews to survive as a community when they were dispersed all over the world.
    - Alexander the Great: He conquered the Near East in a rapid campaign from 333 to 331 BCE. The conqueror died very young, but not before he had founded a city in Egypt that bore his name and became the royal capital of the dynasty of the Ptolemies. He laid the foundations for the Hellenistic world of territorial kingdoms.
    - Hellenism: The national character or culture of Greece.
    - Antiochus IV: Seleucid monarch (175–163 BCE), younger son of Antiochus III. During his reign, violence broke out in Judaea among rival contenders for the high priesthood and over the issue of Hellenism. Trying to restore order, the king attempted to suppress traditional Jewish customs. The struggle against this attempt brought the Maccabees to power. Caused Judaea to quickly disintegrate. When Antiochus passed through Judaea and found inhabitants exulting over his “death” he concluded Judaea ungovernable because of Jewish religion, so he ordered abolition of Jewish customs.
    - Maccabean Revolt: Began in 167 BC - revolt against Seleucid king Antiochus IV who imposed Greek religion, restricting Jewish practices; Antiochus IV was supported by some Jews - after the revolt the Temple was rededicated, which is celebrated in Hanukkah.
    - Hasmonean Dynasty: As part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great, the Land remained a Jewish theocracy under Seleucid rulers. When the Jews were prohibited from practicing Judaism and their Temples was desecrated as part of an effort to impose Greek-oriented culture and customs on the entire population, the Jews rose in revolt. First led by Mattathias of the priestly Hasmonean family and then by his son Judah the Maccabee, the Jews subsequently entered Jerusalem and purified the Temple. Following further Hasmonean victories, the Seleucids restored autonomy to Judea and with the collapse of the Seleucid Kingdom, Jewish independence was again achieved. Under the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted about 80 years, the kingdom regained boundaries not far short of Solomon’s realm, political consolidation under Jewish rule was attained and Jewish life flourished.
    - Herod the Great: Herod: king of Judaea, he was to recapture Roman Kingdom from Parthian occupiers. Under his rule Rome transformed from chaotic republic to military despotism and built Judaea into a large, wealthy kingdom
    - Philo: Jewish philosopher and community leader in Alexandria. Most famous for his allegorical interpretation of the Torah, in which every story and every law carries an important encoded lesson concerning religious experience, the good life, or the nature of God.
    - Pharisees: Members of a religious movement in late Second Temple times; famous as teachers on account of their knowledge of tradition and characterized by careful attention to purity.
    - Sadducees: From the time of John Hyrcanus, all high priests were affiliated with this group, “The Water Libation and the Citrons” provides insight into the Sadducean view of Judaism, refused to be bound by any Jewish custom not explicitly commanded in the Torah; When the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, the Sadducees quickly disappeared
    - Essenes: Some joined the group fully and went to live in its desert headquarters, while others tried to follow Essene teachings but remained in the outside world, the general picture is of a group of people who strove for personal holiness with unusual rigor, avoided common causes of impurity
    - Dead Sea Scrolls: Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient Jewish religious, mostly Hebrew, manuscripts found in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea
    - Josephus: Yosef ben Matityahu was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar and historian who was born in Jerusalem—then part of Roman Judea—to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. He initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian.
    - Vespasian: Roman general and emperor; appointed by Nero to put down the Jewish rebellion of 66. He left during the campaign to take power as emperor and entrusted the Jewish war to his son Titus.
    - Rabbi Yochanan b. Zakkai: en Zakkai faked his own death and had his disciples smuggle him out of Jerusalem in a coffin. They carried the coffin to Vespasian's tent, where ben Zakkai emerged from the coffin. He told Vespasian that he had had a vision (some would say, a shrewd political insight) that Vespasian would soon be emperor, and he asked Vespasian to set aside a place in Yavneh (near modern Rehovot) where he could start a small school and study Torah in peace. Vespasian promised that if the prophesy came true, he would grant ben Zakkai's request. Vespasian became Emperor within a year, and kept his word, allowing the school to be established after the war was over. The school ben Zakkai established at Yavneh became the center of Jewish learning for centuries and replaced Jerusalem as the seat of the Sanhedrin.
    - Yavneh:  In Yavneh, a city near but not in the heart of Judaea, Jews and Greeks lived in an uneasy mixture: the presence of each group kept the other from causing much trouble.
    - Oral Torah: Oral Torah: distinguished the rabbis own teachings, unlike written Torah’s fixed text, Oral was constantly changing. Concept of Oral Torah embodied two basic assumptions: (1) rabbinic teachings represented a heritage faithfully transmitted over countless generations and (2) any rabbi’s version of that heritage had the same legitimacy, the same authority as any others.
    - Halakhah: is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It is based on biblical laws or "commandments", subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books.
    - Mishnah: A compilation of rabbinic teachings, mostly legal, dating from around 200 CE, edited under the supervision of R. Judah the Patriarch (Nasi). The oldest surviving rabbinic book. Consists of six Orders subdivided into a total of sixty-three tractates, each loosely organized around a specific topic, usually of Jewish law.
    - Talmud: Ancient compilations of rabbinic teaching, in the form of loose commentary on selected Mishnaic tractates, thousands of pages long.
    - Midrash: The characteristic style of rabbinic Bible interpretation, aimed at uncovering new layers of meaning through either the combination of seemingly unrelated texts or the examination of minute textual details.
    - Targum: Aramaic translation of scripture.

    ESSAYS/CONCEPTS
    - Major covenants of Tanakh. What is a biblical covenant, what are some of its different forms, and what are some specific examples of each?
    	-----> A biblical covenant is a religious covenant that is described in the Bible. The idea of a covenant is a form of agreement and presupposes two or more parties who come together to make a contract, agree on promises, privileges, and responsibilities. A few major covenants of Tanakh include the Noahide covenant, Abrahamic covenant, and Sinaitic (Mosaic) covenant. The different forms of a covenant is a conditional covenant and an unconditional covenant. A conditional covenant is one based on obligations, where if the requirements are not fulfilled, the covenant is broken. An unconditional covenant is one that will be kept regardless of one party’s infidelity.
    	-----> Found in Genesis 6-9, the Noahide covenant presents a covenant between Noah and God. In the midst of a corrupt society, Noah and his family were the only people God saw worthy of saving because Noah was righteous and lived according to God’s will. When God wipes out the corrupt society as a form of punishment, Noah, his wife, and his three sons survive. Noah then builds God an altar and sacrifices. The Noahide covenant applies to all of humanity and all living creatures, for God promises that never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood. He then establishes a rainbow as a sign of him and Noah’s covenant, along with all living creatures of every kind. Noah and God’s covenant is unconditional, his covenant is everlasting.
    	Found in Genesis 12-17, the Abrahamic covenant presents a covenant between Abraham (previously Abram) and God. In Genesis 12, God calls to Abram and tells him to go from his country and people to the land he will show him, Canaan. God tells Abram that he will make him into a great nation and bless him, that he will make his name great, that he will be a blessing and bless those who bless him, curse those who curse him. In Genesis 15, Abram becomes concerned about who his heir will be since he remains childless, and God tells him not to worry. God appears to Abram once again in Genesis 17, where he establishes a covenant with him and his descendants. God claims that Abram will be the father of many nations and changes his name to Abraham. The covenant that Abraham is to keep is that every male among him shall be circumcised. Though God asks Abraham that every male be circumcised, it is merely a sign of Abraham’s belief of the covenant, therefore, this covenant is unconditional.
    	-----> Found in Exodus 19-24, the Mosaic covenant presents a covenant between God and the Israelites. In Exodus 19, God called to Moses from Mount Sinai and tells him to tell the descendants of Jacob and the people of Israel that he has carried them on wings after what he did to Egypt, and that the people will be his treasured possession if they fully obeyed him and kept his covenant. God will make them a holy nation if they follow his circumstances: to worship only him as God, to not misuse his name, to remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, to honor their parents, and not to murder, commit adultery, theft, lie, covet. God promises blessing to those who obey, and disaster to those who disobey. Since Israelites have obligations and requirements to fulfill, this is a conditional covenant.

    - Problems defining “Bible.”
    	-----> The bible is a collection of materials that were written in a span of multiple centuries. Its writings show a variety of styles and a variety of outlooks on many important questions, which allowed later readers to find many different messages in its pages and to apply those messages to the great variety of situations that they faced. This diversity and flexibility is the key to the Bible’s remarkably long success at sustaining individuals and communities of faith over more than two millennia.
    	-----> However, it presents a very difficult problem in a historian’s point of view. Most of the narratives were written long after the occurences described, and nothing in the Bible can be confirmed from any other ancient source of information. Thus, the Bible cannot be read as a historical record. Rather, the biblical narrative is a distillation of national memory that has been designed to convey a religious message. Though the messages presented are clear, people cannot always know how the events described occurred without the religious purpose, or even how the authors of the Bible learned about those events in the first place.
    	-----> Thus, the key to learning history from the Bible is not to focus on the content of the stories, but rather on the stories themselves. The key questions are: Who told them? Why? How did the people who told these stories understand them? What truths did they find in them? What lessons did they seek to convey?

    - Judaism’s relationship to Hellenism during the Second Temple period and Jewish sectarianism.
    	-----> During the Second Temple period, most of the discussion about the relation of Jews to the surrounding culture concentrated on the Hellenization of Judaism. Since most Jews lived under administration in which Greek was the prestige language for political and intellectual discourse after the conquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great, the impacts of Greek culture as a complex issue. His successors seemed to have made no direct effort to change the conditions in Judaea, however, unplanned changes began to occur as Greek superiority and presence began to affect the natives. As a result, there was the infiltration of Hellenism, or Greek culture. Some people learned to become comfortable with Greek ways, while others looked on with dismay at this departure from ancestral custom.
    	-----> Once Antioch came in power, he began to use Greek culture and the formal structure of the Greek city-state (polis) to hold his own diverse kingdom together. This amounted to a repeal of the Torah, or at least the cancellation of its formal authority: the people of the new Greek city were not compelled to violate the teachings of Moses, but they were now free to do so if they so chose. The king’s choice of high priests and leaders may have been a cause to these developments, since quickly began to introduce changes into the life of Jerusalem. The people were appalled. When Judaeans were exulting over the king’s mistaken death, the king claimed Judaea ungovernable due to the Jewish religion. Thus, he appointed a third high priest who ordered the abolition of traditional Jewish customs and the compulsory Hellenization of the Jewish religion. For instance, they were forced to worship idols, and the possession of the scrolls of the Torah was a crime.
    	-----> All of this chaos resulted in the emergence of organized resistances, from Hasidic resisters. The Hasidim leader Judah “Maccabee” won victories against Greek forces, and gradually the king and his advisors abandoned their attempt to abolish traditional Judaism by force and withdrew their support from the radical Hellenizers who had taken over Jerusalem. Judah and his followers entered the city of Jerusalem and joyously rededicated the purified Temple to the God of their ancestors. This ended the crisis with Hellenization and Judaism.
    	-----> As for Jewish sectarianism, three groups originated and flourished during the brief independence of the Hasmonaean kingdom: Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. The Pharisees represented a group of teachers of the Torah. They took extreme care to maintain ritual purity in their everyday lives. This required separation from the causes of impurity and also from ordinary people. The Sadducees were named for Zadok, the high priest under Solomon, and were a priestly group. They were close to the aristocratic families who had intermarried with the high priestly families. Essenes joined the group fully and went to live in its desert headquarters, while others tried to follow Essene teachings but remained in the outside world.

    - Key aspects of Rabbinic Judaism and its response to the destruction of the Second Temple.
    	-----> The origins of rabbinic Judaism are found when biblical texts were edited and interpreted in the Second Temple period in the land of Israel. It is based on the ideas and beliefs of the Torah and the Oral Torah. A story in the Talmud tells of Yohanan ben Zakkai, who faked his death to gain access to the Roman general Vespasian. He predicted that Vespasian would become the emperor, and when it came true, the new emperor offered the sage a gift, thus the first rabbinic academy was begun. Sages and rabbis shared a dedication to lives based on wisdom and learning, and sought formal recognition as leaders based on that dedication. Growing proportion of the judges in the autonomous Jewish courts were rabbis who found many opportunities to expound their views and communicate their vision of Jewish life. The rabbis had no means of enforcing their program and decisions on others, however, more ordinary Jews began voluntarily accepting rabbis’ authority in their personal lives.
    	-----> As time progressed and rabbis began to exercise recognized public authority, their practice became binding to the Jewish community. Around the year 200 CE, Rabbi Judah changed the character of rabbinic teaching and learning by compiling the Mishnah, which contains a collection of rabbinic teachings on a specific theme, usually a topic of Jewish law. Rabbinic teachers developed the idea that Moses had not written down the entire content of God’s revelation, rather, he had conveyed essential teachings by word of mouth to selected disciples. Thus, the Oral Torah was essential for proper understanding of the written Torah, and the rabbinic sages claimed to be the only heirs to this body of knowledge. In rabbinic understanding, the Torah was God’s foremost set of instructions, and it was their role to clarify the Torah’s rules through careful text study and knowledge of unwritten tradition.
    	-----> The Oral Torah distinguished the rabbi’s own teachings from the ancient words of scripture, and unlike the Torah, it was constantly changing. Rabbis believed that no one but themselves had the right to guide Jewish life, but anyone could aspire to be a rabbi. Concept of Oral Torah embodied two basic assumptions: (1) rabbinic teachings represented a heritage faithfully transmitted over countless generations and (2) any rabbi’s version of that heritage had the same legitimacy, the same authority as any others. Rabbinic teachings started to spread, political and administrative leadership lay in hands of exilarchs, who valued sages for their knowledge of law, and began to appoint them administrative positions. As time went on, Rabbis’ explanations merged with the original Mishnah into a more complex body of teaching known as Talmud. The Talmud’s focus on law reflected the rabbis’ developing role in society.
    	-----> Thus, first stage of formative rabbinic Judaism is represented by the Mishnah, after the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE by the Romans. Rabbinic Judaism interpreted the Torah, however, at the end of the period, rabbinic Judaism synthesized the interpretive, messianic, and priestly traditions. Rabbinic Judaism produced many different texts, ranging from the Mishnah to Midrashic texts and the two Talmuds.

    - Major themes in Deuteronomy. The role of retribution theology.
    	-----> Deuteronomy is the sermon Moses gave to the Children of Israel before they entered into the promised land. Moses reviews the events of the history and the law. Deuteronomy was the second reading of the law. The conditions God gives for entering and holding the promised land for the Israelites was obedience – they entered into the promised land on the condition of obedience. Moses is pleading in this book for obedience. He wanted the law to take a living hold on the people. God is now giving Israel the opportunity to choose Him unlike in the first four books of the Pentateuch when He chose them. After telling the Israelites what blessings would be theirs if they obeyed, Moses also told them of the results of disobedience. Moses then spoke to 80 year old Joshua committing the leadership of the Israelites onto him.
    	-----> Retribution theology is basically the idea that you get what you deserve. God sees to it that the good people get good things in life, and the bad people get bad things. God punishes people in this world in direct response to their actions. ‘

KEY TERMS:
  - Apocalypticism: The religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will. Apocalypticism is often conjoined with the belief that esoteric knowledge that will likely be revealed in a major confrontation between good and evil forces, destined to change the course of history.
  - Apostle Paul: An apostle who taught the gospel of the Christ to the first century world. According to writings in the New Testament and prior to his conversion, Paul was dedicated to persecuting the early disciples of Jesus. 13 of the epistles in the New Testament were attributed to him.  One of his most important contributions to Christian theology was developing a theological framework justification by faith, the concept that humans are saved from sin by believing in Jesus. Paul's epistles continue to be vital roots of the theology, worship and pastoral life in the Catholic and Protestant traditions of the West, as well as the Orthodox traditions of the East. Augustine of Hippo developed Paul's idea that salvation is based on faith and not "works of the law". Martin Luther's interpretation of Paul's writings influenced Luther's doctrine of sola fide.
  - Arian Controversy: A series of Christian theological disputes that arose between Arius and Athanasius of Alexandria, two Christian theologians from Alexandria, Egypt. The most important of these controversies concerned the substantial relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These disagreements divided the Roman Church into two opposing theological factions for over 55 years, from the time before the First Council of Nicaea in 325 until after the First Council of Constantinople in 381.
  - Athanasius: (c.296-373) Doctrine of Theosis (Homoousian Christology) – Same substance (homoousios, “of one substance”). He was a bishop of Alexandria. First Christian to record a canon, compiled 27 books in 367 CE, more importantly he established the New Testament.
  - Augustine: 354, Fourth Century. Bishop of Hippo. Augustine is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity.  He was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, Augustine wrote more than a hundred separate titles, from sermons, to one of the first autobiographies, The Confessions. He talks about original sin and sexual desires. His influence on Church teaching is inestimable.
  - Book of Q: A hypothetical written collection of primarily Jesus' sayings. Q is part of the common material found in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke but not in the Gospel of Mark. Since Mark is the shortest Gospel and has the least original material, Mark was written first and Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source. Since there are many similarities in Matthew and Luke which do not occur in Mark, Matthew and Luke must have had another source.
  - Christ: Greek, “anointed one”. The significance is being able to portray Jesus as the Christ because of the term “messiah.”
  - Christology: The section of Christian theology dealing with the identity of Jesus Christ, particularly the question of the relation of his human and divine natures. Its significant in that it has incredible personal impact on the believer’s daily life, because understanding of Jesus Christ is crucial to salvation.
  - Church Crusades: 1095 – 1291, The Crusades were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The term church crusades is applied to church-sanctioned campaigns. They were for the resolution of conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups.
  - Constantine: During the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (AD 306–337), Christianity began to transition to the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. Constantine's decision to cease the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was a turning point for early Christianity. In 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan decriminalizing Christian worship. He calls up the Council of Nicea in 325. The emperor became a great patron of the Church and set a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor within the Church.
  - Consubstantiation: A term used to refer to the theology of the real presence, especially associated with Martin Luther, which holds that the substance of the eucharistic bread and wine are given together with the substance of the body and blood of Christ (symbolic). As compared to transubstantiation, the doctrine according to which the bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Christ in the eucharist, while retaining their outward appearance.
  - Council of Chalcedon: 451 CE. Considered the last of the early/major "Ecumenical" Councils by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and most Protestants. The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons governing church administration and authority. Doctrine of Incarnation: Jesus is God. Doctrine of Two Natures: Belief that Jesus is both divine and human; Jesus is perfectly human and divine. Response to Monophysites. Response to Nestorians who claimed Jesus, the word incarnate is of two separate, substances (human and divine substance separate). Resolved the disputes over nature of Jesus. The council’s ruling was an important step in further clarifying the nature of Christ and the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. The council also laid the groundwork for one of the most significant events in ecclesiastical history—the Great Schism.
  - Council of Nicea: 325 CE in Nicaea (in modern day Turkey), convened 220 bishops. It  is considered the first ecumenical council of the Christian church. Its main goal was to settle the Christological issue of the divine nature of God the Son and his relationship to God the Father: are God the Father and the Son of the same substance? Athanasius and Arius represented 2 sides of a debate on the question of whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the father and resolved in favor of Athanasius.  Established Nicene Creed. This ecumenical council was the first effort to attain consensus.
  - Council of Trent: (1545-1563) Considered the most important Church Council between Nicaea (325) and Vatican II (1962-65). It laid foundation for renewal of both the discipline and the spiritual life of the church and marked the beginning of early modern Roman Catholic practice, and formulated Catholic theology and practice in response to the Protestant Reformation. Its main accomplishments were the clarification of Church teachings, elimination of abuses within the Church, reiterating an understanding of Mass as a sacrifice, and development of the Society of Jesuits.
  - Ecumenical Council: An ecumenical council is when the entire Church, through the bishops, gathers together to address one or more issues vital to the life of the universal Church at a given period of time. They are significant because they most often spend their time identifying and condemning heresy, instigating needed reforms, dealing with questions of church authority, and addressing other significant issues as they have emerged in various historical periods.
  - Edict of Milan: A proclamation that permanently established religious toleration for Christianity within the Roman Empire. It was the outcome of a political agreement concluded in Milan between the Roman emperors Constantine I and Licinius in February 313. The proclamation granted all persons freedom to worship whatever deity they pleased, assured Christians of legal rights, and directed the prompt return to Christians of confiscated property. Previous edicts of toleration had been as short-lived as the regimes that sanctioned them, but this time the edict effectively established religious toleration.
  - Gospel: 'Good News'; the message concerning Christ, the kingdom of God, and salvation.  Used to refer to the first four books of the Christian New Testament which tell the story of Jesus' earthly ministry. A written account of the career and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. The term originally meant the Christian message itself, but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out. The four gospels of the New Testament- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John- are the main source of information on the life of Jesus. The Gospels are the most important resource in a study of Christianity because it was the story of Jesus’s life. Christians obtain most of their knowledge and understanding of Jesus from the Gospels.
  - Gospel of Thomas: It can be called a gospel even though it’s not included in the New Testament because because it’s not canonized. Christian non-canonical sayings gospel that many scholars believe provides insight into the oral gospel traditions. This manuscript contains 114 sayings attributed to Jesus. Some of these sayings resemble sayings found in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The gospel of Thomas was not written by Jesus' disciple Thomas. The early Christian leaders universally recognized the gospel of Thomas as a forgery. It was rejected by the vast majority of early Christians and contains many teachings that are in contradiction to the biblical Gospels and the rest of the New Testament.
  - Homoiousia: Arian view that Christ was “of similar substance” to God, as opposed to the Greek view “of the same substance.” The significance of homoiousia is that it tried to figure out the composition of Jesus in relation to God. This was included in the Council of Nicea, which happened in 325.
  - Homoousia: Greek, “of the same substance” as opposed to the Arian view that Christ was “of similar substance” (homoiousios) to God. The significance of homoousia was that it tried to figure out the composition of Jesus in relation to God. This was included in the Council of Nicea, which happened in 325.
  - Hypostatic Union: Hypostatic union is the idea of the combination of divine and human natures in the single person of Christ. Human and divine joined together; the substance of divinity and humanity are not separate, nor are they mixed, but fully joined together permanently.
  - Indulgences: In the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, an indulgence is "a way to reduce the amount of punishment one has to undergo for sins." It may reduce the "temporal punishment for sin" after death (as opposed to the eternal punishment merited by mortal sin), in the state or process of purification called Purgatory. Indulgences were one of the major sources of financial and moral corruption in the Catholic church of the middle ages. Indulgences were also the direct cause of Martin - Luther's break with the church, and hence one of the major causes of the Reformation.
  - John Calvin: Theologian, pastor and reformer during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology, aspects of which include the doctrines of predestination and of the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation. Calvin made a powerful impact on the fundamental doctrines of Protestantism, and is widely credited as the most important figure in the second generation of the Protestant Reformation.
  - Martin Luther: Luther was an influential figure in the Protestant Reformation. He came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the Catholic view on indulgences. Luther proposed a discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his Ninety-five Theses of 1517. He taught that salvation and eternal life are not earned by good deeds but are received only as the free gift of God's grace through the believer's faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin. He was one of the most influential figures in Western history. His writings were responsible for fractionalizing the Catholic Church and sparking the Protestant Reformation.
  - Monasticism: A religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual work. Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions.
  - Monophysitism: The doctrine that there is only one nature in Christ, which is divine (Gk. Monos—one, and physis—nature).  This view differed from the orthodox view, upheld by the Council of Chalcedon (451), that Christ had two natures, one divine and one human.
  - Original Sin: is the Christian doctrine of humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The idea that people are sinful from birth, due to Adam’s sin.
  - Patristic Period: One of the major periods of Christian history. Period between the closing of the NT (beginning of the 2nd cent) and the Council of Chalcedon 451. It was also known as the Era of the Fathers of the Church. Consisted of writings of thinkers whose work played a role in the development of church doctrine.
  - Pelagius: Pelagius was a British monk, probably of Irish origin.  He came to Rome in 400 and was distressed at the low state of conduct there.  He felt that there was need of more moral effort, that humans have a possibility of “willing and effecting any good work.”  Whereas for Augustine we are justified through the grace of God, for Pelagius, humans are justified on their own merits.  Humans can attain salvation through their good deeds. Pelagius denies original sin. Pelagianism contended that humans are not born tainted by sin but could choose to be good or evil based on free will.
  - Reformation and Counter-Reformation: Reformation, 1517 – 1648, specifically referred to as the Protestant Reformation, reformation was a schism in Western Christianity initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th-century.  Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety-five Theses and began by criticising the sale of indulgences. The reformation comes to incorporate doctrinal changes such as sola fide and sola scriptura. / Counter-Reformation also called the Catholic Reformation was the period of Catholic resurgence initiated in response to the Reformation, or the Protestant Reformation, beginning with the Council of Trent. Initiated to preserve the power, influence and material wealth enjoyed by the Catholic Church and to present a theological and material challenge to Reformation, the Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort composed of defense of Catholic sacramental practice, religious orders, and spiritual movements. There was a recognition in that some of what Martin Luther was attacking was true and needed to be addressed, so the counter reformation addresses some of those abuses with the ending of indulgences.
  - Sacraments: Describes rites instituted by Jesus. A sacrament is a religious ceremony or act of the Christian Church that is regarded as an outward and visible sign of inward and spiritual divine grace. The sacraments of the Protestant churches are baptism and the Lord's Supper. The sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church and Greek Orthodox churches are baptism, confirmation, the Eucharist, matrimony, penance, holy orders, and extreme unction. Seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church,  and many Orthodox Churches: Baptism, Holy Eucharist, Penance (Reconciliation), Confirmation, Marriage,  Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders. In a way, it signifies God’s grace that is outwardly visible.
  - Second Adam: The second Adam was Jesus because he comes to rectify and fix the sin of Adam and resolve it. Jesus is the "second Adam" in the sense that he was the last man who did not have a sinful nature, thus, he was able to be the sinless sacrifice for the sins of the world.
  - Sola Fide: By Faith Alone. (The belief that faith in Jesus is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin.) The idea of justification by faith, the concept that humans are saved from sin by believing in Jesus. A theological framework for understanding that Jesus' death and resurrection triggered a fundamental change in humanity's relationship with God a relationship in which faith, rather than behavior, was the central element.
  - Sola Scriptura: By Scripture Alone. (Scripture as the only source of proper belief.) Sola scriptura means that Scripture alone is authoritative for the faith and practice of the Christian. It was a foundational doctrinal principle of the Protestant Reformation held by the Reformers, who taught that authentication of Scripture is governed by the discernible excellence of the text as well as the personal witness of the Holy Spirit to the heart of each man.
  - Synoptic Problem: The synoptic problem is the question of the specific literary relationship among the three synoptic gospels—that is, the question as to the source upon which gospel depended when it was written. The texts of the three synoptic gospels often agree very closely in wording and order, both in quotations and in narration.
  - Tertullian: Responded to certain Jewish challenges against Christianity. He opposed gnosticism. Helped develop ideas of trinity and homoousia. Church father in the Patristic era.
  - Theotokos: The Virgin Mary is the Theotokos, the mother of Jesus Christ, the Son and Word of God. She conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit. She was cared for by her betrothed husband, Joseph, who took the child and his mother into his home as his own. One very strong tradition in the Orthodox Church holds that the birth of Jesus was also miraculous and left Mary's virginity intact as a sign; it is also the tradition of the Church that Joseph and Mary did not have relations after the birth of Jesus. The title Theotokos is a Greek word that means "God-bearer" or "Birth-giver to God."
  - Thomas Aquinas: Philosopher and theologian, and an authority of the Roman Catholic Church and a prolific writer. Combining the theological principles of faith with the philosophical principles of reason, he ranked among the most influential thinkers of medieval Scholasticism. St. Thomas Aquinas's work goes on to discuss faith and reason's roles in both perceiving and proving the existence of God.
  - Transubstantiation: The doctrine according to which the bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Christ in the eucharist, while retaining their outward appearance. As compared to consubstantiation, a term used to refer to the theology of the real presence, which holds that the substance of the eucharistic bread and wine are given together with the substance of the body and blood of Christ (symbolic).
  - Trinity: The Christian doctrine of the Trinity holds that God is three consubstantial persons or —the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit—as "one God in three Divine Persons". The three Persons are distinct, yet are one "substance, essence or nature" (homoousios). There is only one God in three Persons: while distinct from one another in their relations of origin and in their relations with one another, they are stated to be one in all else, co-equal, co-eternal and consubstantial, and each is God, whole and entire. By studying and understanding the trinity, people are able to grasp a better and deeper understanding of God.
  - Typology: A doctrine or theory concerning the relationship of the Old Testament to the New Testament. It uses biblical characters and figures from a christological point and perspective, viewing them within a framework of Jesus. For example, taking Moses figure and identifying the Jesus qualities of Moses and saying how Moses is a precursor to Jesus, or highlights certain qualities of Jesus and Jesus exhibits those qualities as well. Or, that Jesus is an Adam figure who comes to rectify the sin of Adam and resolve it (Second Adam). So it’s a christological reading of the Old Testament sources. This is important to understand Christian interpretation of the Old Testament because so much of it is typological.

  ESSAYS/CONCEPTS:
  - Discuss the synoptic problem and its implications on the Gospels.
  	-----> The synoptic problems is the question of how to explain the similarities and differences among the synoptic gospels. The synoptic gospel is the referred to as the first three gospels- Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These accounts are very similar to one another in content and expression in that they discussed similar subject matter, exact wording, and even order of events, but commonly different from John’s gospel. The similarities among the Synoptic Gospels have led some to wonder if the Gospel authors had a common source, another written account of Christ’s birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection from which they obtained the material for their Gospels.
  	-----> Some believe that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are so similar because they used each other’s Gospels or another common source. There are many theories that formulated that tried to explain the reason behind these similarities. For example, the Traditional Augustinian Theory states that Matthew was the first gospel that was composed, followed by Mark, then Luke. Many view this Matthean priority because of statements from Church fathers, including Augustine himself, “first Matthew, then Mark, third Luke, and last John." Another theory is the Two-Source Theory, which is the most widely accepted theory amongst New Testament scholars today. It settles the problems that arise with Matthean priority, and claims that both Matthew and Luke separately used Mark as a source. Matthew reproduces the vast majority of Mark, while Luke also incorporates more than half. In addition to using Mark as a source, Matthew and Luke also used a common source called Q. Because there was no proof that the documents of the Q ever existed, ne of the only areas of consensus regarding Q is that it antedates both Matthew and Luke. Thus, Q remains a hypothesis and can be considered one of the few solutions to the Synoptic Problem.
  	-----> Thus, the synoptic problem was the question regarding the similarities between the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The implications of the problem on the gospels was that each of them were derived from one another, or that they are all derived from a common source. There are many debates and theories that attempt to explain the reasons behind these similarities and which author used another as a source, and many solutions to this problem including the Q.

  - Discuss the concept of the trinity and the various controversies associated with it.
  	-----> The Christian doctrine of the Trinity holds that God is three consubstantial persons or —the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit—as "one God in three Divine Persons". The three Persons are distinct, yet are one "substance, essence or nature" (homoousios), as stated in the Council of Nicea. There is only one God in three Persons. They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin and in their relations with one another and are stated to be one in all else, co-equal, co-eternal and consubstantial, and each is God, whole and entire. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are said to share one nature, but the Father is not the same person as the Son, the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as the Father.
  	-----> There were many debates that dealt with the issues and controversies of the Trinity. For example, homoousia and homoiousia was a debate about the Trinity. Homoiousia was the Arian view that Christ was “of similar substance” to God, while homoousia was the Greek view that Christ was “of the same substance” to God. They differed in figuring out the composition of Jesus in relation to God. Other debates that dealt with the issues and controversies of the Trinity were held in the Council of Chalcedon and the Councill of Nicea. In these councils, proper terminology was a primary issues, along with the precision of thought and the philosophical categories used to characterize the Trinitarian and Christological doctrines. The Council of Nicaea resolved the question of Jesus’ deity, but led to further dissent about Jesus’ human and divine natures. These issues culminated in the expression of the doctrine at Chalcedon.

  - What issues prompted the Councils of Nicea and Chalcedon, and what impact did they have on the development and evolution of Christianity?
    -----> The Council of Nicea took place in AD 325 by order of the Roman Emperor Constantine. At the Council of Nicea, Emperor Constantine presided over a group of church bishops and other leaders with the purpose of the issues of defining the nature of God for all of Christianity and eliminating confusion, controversy, and contention within the church. Constantine encouraged the church leaders to settle their internal disagreements of doctrinal differences. Furthermore, the council resolved some escalating controversies among the church leadership and issues of debates of the nature of Jesus Christ and homoousia, which was the main theological issue.
  	-----> The Council of Chalcedon met in AD 451 in Chalcedon. Similar the the Council of Nicea, the issues that prompted this council included the same matters of theology and concerns of the church structure. The council laid the groundwork for one of the most significant events in ecclesiastical history—the Great Schism (between the Eastern Church and the Western Church).
  	-----> The impact that the Council of Nicea had on the development and evolution of Christianity was that it affirmed the apostles’ teaching of who Christ is—the one true God and the Second Person of the Trinity, with the Father and the Holy Spirit. The impact that the Council of Chalcedon on the development and evolution of Christianity was that it was an important step in further clarifying the nature of Christ and the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. It affirmed that Christ is truly God and truly man, and that he is consubstantial and homoousios with the Father.

  - Describe the core concepts of the Pauline Epistles in relation to the teachings of Jesus. How do they reflect continuity or discontinuity with the Gospel/Jesus Movement teachings?
    -----> The Pauline Epistles are the 13 letters written by the apostle Paul that are included in the canon of Scripture. It contains much of the doctrine the Christian faith is built upon, especially in relationship to salvation, and how the church should function, containing teaching on spiritual gifts, qualifications of church leaders, the role of women in ministry, and the relationship between law and grace in the life of a Christ-follower. The themes of and topics covered in the Pauline Epistles included the lordship of Christ, resurrection, justification, grace, and faith.
  	-----> The resurrection, justification in Christ, and the Eucharist (the Lord’s Supper) are three key areas of continuity between the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels, and the teachings of Paul in his letters. Jesus taught about the resurrection to His disciples, which was continued on by Paul within his epistles. Justice and faith is the means of appropriating the benefits of Jesus’s death, which was also continued in Paul’s epistles. In short, Paul’s teachings are the accurate and true teachings of Christ.

  - Discuss the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation.
    -----> Reformation, also called Protestant Reformation, the religious theological revolution against the abuses and totalitarian control of the Roman Catholic Church that took place in the Western church in the 16th century. Its greatest leaders undoubtedly were Martin Luther and John Calvin. Both Luther and Calvin protested various unbiblical practices of the Catholic Church and promoted a return to sound biblical doctrine. The cause of the event of the Protestant Reformation is generally considered to be Luther’s posting of his Ninety-five Theses, which was a list of propositions of what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling unconditional indulgences. One of the foundational issues leading to the Protestant Reformation was a major difference between Roman Catholics and Protestants: Catholics place church teaching and tradition on a level equal to Scripture itself. Protestant Reformers developed the Five Solas, five essential points of biblical doctrine that clearly separated Protestantism from Roman Catholicism. These Five Solas were the reason for the Protestant Reformation because it was their call for the church to return to biblical teaching.
  	-----> The Counter-Reformation was Roman Catholicism’s response to the Protestant Reformation. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Christians began to openly criticize the Roman Catholic Church for teaching things contrary to the Bible. As the Reformation took hold culturally and theologically, Catholicism responded with its own efforts and resist the claims of the Reformers. One of the effects of the Counter-Reformation was the Council of Trent, which was an attempt to change aspects of Catholicism that Protestants disagreed with. As a result, the sale of indulgences was stopped and the roles of priests were more carefully defined. The most critical issue was that most of the Counter-Reformation was mostly a doubling-down on entrenched Catholic theology. The council defended transubstantiation, upheld the necessity of sacraments for salvation, rejected sola fide, and claimed outright that Catholic tradition was as equally authoritative as the Bible. Thus, the primary effect of the Counter-Reformation was to stabilize and reinforce Catholic errors.

- Sunnis: The largest denomination of Islam. Its name comes from the word Sunnah, referring to the exemplary behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

ESSAYS/CONCEPTS:
- Describe the nature of life in the Arabian Peninsula before the advent of Islam. What were the major changes introduced by Muhammad?
  -----> Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. Some of the settled communities developed into distinctive civilizations, which consisted of indigenous polytheistic beliefs. It is called the period of Jahiliyyah that is the age of ignorance.
	-----> The most remarkable feature of the political life of Arabia before Islam was the total absence of political organization in any form. No part of the Arabian peninsula had any government at any time, and the Arabs never acknowledged any authority other than the authority of the chiefs of their tribes. The authority of the tribal chiefs, however, rested, in most cases, on their character and personality, and was moral rather than political.
	-----> Economically, the Jews were the leaders of Arabia. They were the owners of the best arable lands in Hijaz, and they were the best farmers in the country. The most important urban centers of Arabia were Mecca and Medina, both in Hijaz.
	-----> Many social changes took place under Islam between 610 and 661, including the period of Muhammad's mission and the rule of his four immediate successors who established the Rashidun Caliphate. The Islamic conquest lowered taxes, and provided greater local autonomy and religious freedom for Jews and as well as most of the Christian Churches in the conquered areas.

- What does the Fatihah reflect about Islamic belief?
  -----> Fatihah  is the first chapter (surah) of the Quran. Its seven verses are a prayer for the guidance, lordship and mercy of God. This chapter has an essential role in Islamic prayer. The primary literal meaning of the expression "al-Fātiḥah" is "The Opener.” Most narrators recorded that al-Fātiḥah was the first complete Surah revealed to Muhammad. Some Muslims interpret it as a reference to an intended ability of the Surah to open a person’s faith in Allah. It is the essential part of daily prayers and has to be recited every day.
	-----> Fatihah is often believed to be a synthesis of the Quran. It in itself is a prayer at the very beginning of the Quran, which acts as a preface of the Quran and implies that the book is for a person who is a seeker of truth—a reader who is asking a deity who is the only one worthy of all praise (and is the creator, owner, sustainer of the worlds etc.) to guide him to a straight path.
	-----> The Fatihah reflects and emphasizes the Islamic belief of the significance of prayer. It is important that an individual must start with the Fatihah in order to begin the prayer, and it must be recited in order to seek Allah, which ultimately reflects the importance of this opening chapter. Another use of the Fatihah is for daily life problems, so if someone is sick, for example, they can recite the surah for help.

- What role does orality and recitation play in the Qur’an both in its origins as well as its role in Islamic ritual and faith?
  -----> Quran literally means the recitation. In the Quran, Allah is reciting his words to mankind through patterns of Arabic text. Prophet Muhammad received this revelation in the Arabic language and passed it down to his followers through oral recitation. Muslims are required to recite Quran verses at least five times a day, in their daily prayers. This is known as Salah, through which, one creates a spiritual link with Allah through reciting His words during prayer.
	-----> Each Ramadan, the Prophet would repeat after the angel Gabriel reciting the entire Qur’an in its exact order as far as it had been revealed, while in the presence of a number of his Companions. As the Companions spread out to various provinces with different populations, they took their recitations with them in order to instruct others. In this way, the same Qur’an became widely retained in the memories of many people across vast and diverse areas of land.
	-----> In short, the orality and recitation play an important role in the Qur’an both in its origins as well as its role in Islamic ritual and faith. It was crucial for Islamic ritual and faith to recite the Quran correctly. Muslims believed that through proper orality and recitation, the Quran and the words of God would be preserved in the way they were first revealed to Prophet Muhammad. In a way, the recitation and orality of the Quran help Muslims guard the sacred texts of the Quran as well as the Islamic ritual and faith.

- Discuss the role of Muhammad as a prophet. What is his relationship to earlier prophets and how does he differ?
  -----> The final and complete revelation of the faith was made through the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE. Once Angel Gabriel visited Muhammad and mentioned the name of Allah in 610, Muhammad began to recite words which he came to believe were the words of God. During the rest of his life Muhammad continued to receive these revelations. The words were remembered and recorded, and form the text of the Holy Quran, the Muslim scripture. Muhammad took his followers on a journey from Mecca to Medina in 622. This journey is called the Hijrah (migration) and the event was seen as so important for Islam that 622 is the year in which the Islamic calendar begins. From this time on he was generally accepted by the faithful as the true final Prophet of God. Muhammad continued to lead his community both spiritually and in earthly matters until his death in 632. Any person can find truths in Prophet Muhammad's life that constitute an example for them to follow.
	-----> Ishmael is recognized as an important prophet and patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that Ishmael was the firstborn of Abraham, born to him from his second wife Hagar. Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent Arab tribes and being the forefather of Muhammad. Moses is considered to be a prophetic predecessor to Muhammad. Generally attributed the tale of Moses as a spiritual parallel to the life of Muhammad, considering many aspects of their lives to be shared. according to Islamic tradition, Moses was one of the many prophets Muhammad met in the event of the Mi'raj, when he ascended through the seven heavens.

- Discuss the issues surrounding succession after Muhammad’s death and their consequences.
  -----> The succession to Muhammad is the central issue that divided the Muslim community into several divisions in the first century of Muslim history. A few months prior to his death, Muhammad delivered a sermon where he announced that Ali ibn Abi Talib would be his successor. After the sermon, Muhammad ordered the Muslims to pledge allegiance to Ali.
	-----> However, just after Muhammad passed away, a group of Muslims met at Saqifa, where Umar ibn al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr then assumed political power, and his supporters became known as the Sunnis.
	-----> Despite that, a group of Muslims kept their allegiance to Ali. These people, who became known as Shias, held that while Ali's right to be the political leader may have been taken, he was still the religious and spiritual leader after Muhammad.
	-----> Eventually, after the deaths of Abu Bakr and two other Sunni leaders, Umar and Uthman, the Sunni Muslims went to Ali for political leadership. After Ali died, his son Hasan succeeded him, both politically and, according to Shias, religiously. According to the Sunnis, whoever held political power was considered the successor to Muhammad, while the Shias held the twelve Imams (Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Husain's descendants) were the successors to Muhammad, even if they did not hold political power.

- How is authority established within sacred texts in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam? What tensions arise in differing textual and oral traditions?
  -----> The Torah was the foundational text of Judaism and is part of the larger text from the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Of the variety of movements within Judaism, Rabbinic Judaism held that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. However, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic -----> Judaism during the Second Temple period. //  Authority is not vested in a single person or body, but rather in sacred texts, religious law, and learned rabbis who interpret the texts and laws. God revealed the Torah to Moses at Mount Sinai. Authority rests upon God's will and word to Moses. Since what God gave to Moses, in particular, was the Torah, it follows that God's will reaches us in the Torah, and we obey the Torah because it is what God tells us to do. If we want to know what is authoritative, we therefore must refer to the Torah. A rabbi is simply a teacher, a person sufficiently educated in halakhah (Jewish law) and tradition to instruct the community and to answer questions and resolve disputes regarding halakhah.
	-----> The Bible was the foundational text of Christianity. It consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. The Bible holds authority in Christianity because it is the inspired Word of God. "All authority has been given unto the victorious Christ; he is head over all things to the church, and his word will judge us in the last day." In Roman Catholicism it is argued that the church, with its pope and his cardinals, has the authority to interpret the Bible and to legislate law for the church. The larger Protestant churches look to their creedal statements as authoritative. Jesus says authority does directly from Heaven so there is no need for leadership or hierarchy.
	-----> Quran holds the authority of the word of God in Islam. Islam has no official priesthood and therefore no official hierarchy within the Ummah - "priesthood of all believers."Imam in Shiite Islam is the one rightful, divinely mandated religious authority.

- Discussion the concept of “supersession” in Christianity, in relation to Judaism, and in Islam in relation to both Judaism and Christianity.
  -----> Supersession in Christianity is a theological view on the current status of the church in relation to the Jewish people and Judaism. It holds that the Christian Church has succeeded the Israelites as the definitive people of God or that the New Covenant has replaced or superseded the Mosaic covenant. Many Christian theologians saw the New Covenant in Christ as a replacement for the Mosaic Covenant. Statements on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church have claimed its ecclesiastical structures to be a fulfillment and replacement of Jewish ecclesiastical structures. Many Early Christian commentators taught that the Old Covenant was fulfilled and replaced (superseded) by the New Covenant in Christ, and Augustine follows these views of the early Church Fathers, but he emphasizes the importance to Christianity of the continued existence of the Jewish people.
	-----> The Islamic tradition views Islam as the final and most authentic expression of Abrahamic prophetic monotheism, superseding both Jewish and Christian teachings. The doctrine of tahrif teaches that earlier monotheistic scriptures or their interpretations have been corrupted, while the Quran presents a pure version of the divine message that they originally contained. The Islamic doctrine of tahrif in its canonical form teaches that Jewish and Christian scriptures or their interpretations have been corrupted, which has obscured the divine message that they originally contained. According to this doctrine, the Qur'an both points out and corrects errors introduced by previous corruption of monotheistic scriptures, which makes it the final and most pure divine revelation.
	-----> Judaism rejects supersessionism.

- How is salvation, or being in right relationship with God, expressed in the classic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam? How do each of the three religions understand the requirements for salvation?
  -----> In a Christian perspective, salvation refers to eternal and spiritual deliverance as well as a person’s eternal destiny. In the Christian doctrine of salvation, individuals are saved from a God’s judgement of sin. Their sins are what separates them from God and the consequences of these sins result in death. Biblical salvation refers to the deliverance from the consequence of sin, which involves the removal of these sins. Only God can deliver people from sin’s consequence and only God can remove sin. Furthermore, God rescued these individuals through Christ, which also achieved their salvation. Salvation is received through faith. The requirements for salvation are to hear the gospel, the good news of Jesus’s death and resurrection and to believe and trust the Lord Jesus. This involves a change of mind about sin and christ.
	-----> Judaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Rather, Jews place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God embodied in the Torah. In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of redemption, a saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided an individual honours God by observing his precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.
	-----> In Islam, salvation refers to the eventual entrance to heaven. Islam teaches that people who die disbelieving in the God do not receive salvation. Those who die believing in the One God and his message (Islam) receive salvation. Islam teaches that all who enter into Islam must remain so in order to receive salvation. Islam also stresses that in order to gain salvation, one must also avoid sinning along with performing good deeds. No one can gain salvation simply by virtue of their belief or deeds, instead it is the Mercy of God, which merits them salvation. Furthermore, not performing the mandatory acts of worship (the Five Pillars of Islam) may deprive Muslims of the chance of salvation.

- What role does Abraham play in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?
  -----> Judaism: In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God. Abraham known as the Patriarch, both the physical and spiritual ancestor of Judai\sm. They founded the religion now known as Judaism, and their descendants are the Jewish people. Abraham and the Binding of Isaac- God was testing Abraham to see if he would actually kill his own son, as a test of his loyalty. insinuation that God remains with Hagar and Ishmael. // In Jewish history he is seen as the ancestor and father of all Jews, the first Hebrew, he was very faithful and God made a covenant with Abraham, which is why circumcision is used in the Jewish faith today. In Jewish tradition, Abraham means "our father Abraham," signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew.
	-----> Christianity: Jesus Christ is traced back to Abraham, not this carnal descent from Abraham to which importance is attached but importance is placed on practicing the virtues attributed to Abraham in Genesis. Thus in John, 8, the Jews say (33): "We are the seed of Abraham", and Jesus replies (39): "If ye be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham". Galatians views covenant with Abraham as enslaving. Jerusalem is the one that upholds the covenant. // He is the prototype (first model) of all believers, Jewish or Gentile.
	-----> Islam: Abraham is the model of one goes and walks around and prays in the pace connected with Allah. He is emulated for all time. He is the ideal person of faith. Abraham was led to Mecca by Allah, and is the ideal one who worships in the city of God. Establishes the people of God. // He is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. Muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch, the archetype of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic traditions consider Abraham the first Pioneer of Islam, and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the Oneness of God.
